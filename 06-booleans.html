 result2 = 'falsy'

/*
AND OPERATOR && :checks if 2 sides are both truthy.
value1 && value2. The AND OPERATOR is special becos it imposible for both side to be truthy,
thus once value1 is false, it doesnt  need to check the right side  and
so it doesnt bother to run the code on the right and this is caled (Short-circuit Evaluation).
Thus, the && is called the Guard operator because its like a shortcut to guide the code on the right side once the codeon the left is falsy. eg*/ false && console.log('hello') //the console would not run becos it will stop since value1is false. the above code is a shortcort for the if statement
/*if( condition) {
'Hello'
}*/

const message = false && 'hello'; // it can as well be stored in a variable
console.log(message)// in this case the value false will be saved in to the variable message

const message2 = 5 && 'hello'; // 5 is a truthy value
console.log(message2) // soit will console.log the second value 'hello' which will be saved into the variable message.


/*
DEFAULT OPERATOR ||,the OR checks if at least one sides  is truthy
value1 || value2.if the left side (value1) is truthy, then we dont need to check the rightside,the code stops runing
