/*
objets can have properties and methods.
Strings can also have properties and methods. eg the property .length.
*/
console.log('Hello'.length)// used the length of the string
console.log('Hello'.toLocaleUpperCase()) //gives the string in uppercase.
const object3 = {
message: 'Good job!',
price: 344
}
//Destructuring: is a shortcut to take a variable out of an object.
//const message = object3.message
const { message, price } = object3
/*  Explanation  of the above: this is the same as const message = object3.message. this how to get the value out of the object.
this takes the message and price property out of the object and store it inside a variable called message and price respectively*/


//another things desstructuring  does is that you can store the value of an object into another object eg

 const object6 = {
  //message: message;  this will display the value of message property from const { message, price } = object3
  message,//
  method: function fun1 (){
    console.log('method practice')
  },
//theabove is the same as the below.The below method iscaled the shorthand method
  method (){
console.log('method practice')
  }

 }
 console.log(object6)
 // in the case when both property and value of an object are using the same name  such as the case of
 //"message: message". we can use the the shorthand property by just weiting one name to represent both
 // property and value i.e just message only into the object. another things desstructuring  does is that you can store the value of an object into another object
